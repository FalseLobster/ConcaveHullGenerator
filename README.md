# Deprecated documentation: Incoming updates coming soon!
**Major changes:** `Concavity` parameter has been reversed (mathematically it makes sense this way). Setting  to -1 will leave the hull convex, while rising it to 1 will add add up to 0ยบ angles. `isSquareGrid` boolean is also gone (tangent lines are now always checked)

# Concave hull generator
Unite all dots under the smallest possible area. It comes with a simple demo for unity using just gizmos.

## How it works
Inspired by *[Implementation of a fast and efficient concave hull algorith](http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/projektTDB/ht13/project10/Project-10-report.pdf)*, the concave hull is reached through the finding of middlepoints within the edges of the convex hull. If the cosine between the middlepoint and the edge nodes is greater than the `concavity`variable the segment will be partitioned in two new ones using the new point. The search for middlepoints starts from the longest edge to the shortest. If no middlepoints are found the program will end.

Middlepoints are searched in an area around the edge that can be set using the `scaleFactor` variable. The higher the area the slower the program will be.
